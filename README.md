## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Applications: Robinhood: i love how everything is put perfectly in place. I also love how the buttons look like.
TradingView: Again everything looks clean and nice. Love the the functionality of this app. As you can open charts and then look at them closly.
Venmo: I love trhe visuals in this application, as well as the transitions. For example when you scroll down and then go back up on the main screen.


An App I would like to build is Get Yoked. It is a pwa that I created a a couple of months ago for a class project from scratch. It is a gym lift logger website which I would love to create into a swift app so i can use more features that I cant use with a pwa.


## Notes

Didnt really run into challenges, the interface just looks a bit overwhelming, so I think I need to understand it a bit more and so does the coding part. I am a bit confused on that.
